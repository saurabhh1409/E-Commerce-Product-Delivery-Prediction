# E-Commerce-Product-Delivery-Prediction

## Project Overview
In the modern e-commerce industry, timely delivery is crucial to customer satisfaction and brand reputation. This project focuses on predicting whether a product will be delivered on time based on various logistical, customer, and product-related factors. Using a supervised machine learning approach, the model classifies deliveries as on-time or late, helping businesses optimize their operations and reduce delays.

## Dataset Summary
Dataset Size: 10,999 rows Ã— 12 columns<br>
Source: Internal e-commerce operations data from Indian IT cities<br>
Objective: Predict whether a product delivery will reach the customer on time (Reached.on.Time_Y.N)<br>

## Project Workflow
 1. Data Preprocessing
        - Handling missing values (if any)
        - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Shipment Mode)
        -Feature scaling and transformation

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        -Distribution of on-time vs late deliveries
        -Relationship between delays and product weight, shipment mode, etc.
        -Correlation heatmaps and boxplots

 3. Model Building
        -Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
        -Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
        -Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
